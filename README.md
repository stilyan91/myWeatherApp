# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This is my first react app for weather forecast. It has a guest part where you can search for a location and see weather forecast for next 5 days. You can register and login. For authenticated users you can add some location in favorites and have access to 12 hours weather forecast. These favorites locations can be edited and deleted.
